## Overview

`Genvej` is Read Trimmer for Next Generation Sequencing Data program written in Python3. 

`Genvej` provides a consistent set of verbs that help you trim reads from FASTQ files.
These files may be compressed, uncompressed, encoded in with PHRED 64 or PHRED 33 quality scores. 

* `--shear ` Trims 3' prime end of a read by (x) amount of nucleotides

* `--snip `  Trims 5' prime end of a read by (x) amount of nucleotides 

* `--filename ` is a prefix to the filename entered  

* `--trim_minimum ` Trims reads based on a minimum quality score using PHRED 33 only.

* `--name` Receive a friendly welcome message

* `--version` Display the version of the program

* `--cite ` Display the citation for the paper associated with the program


You can learn more about the functions in the help section of the program `--help`.
